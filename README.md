## General info
Quiz about coding created primarily using Javascript

## Technologies
* Visual Studio Code

## Features
List of features ready:
* User clicks button to start the quiz. 
* There are multiple choice questions and a countdown timer. After choice is made, the next question appears.
* Each correct answer adds to score. Each incorrect answer detracts from score and takes time off the clock.
* Message of "Correct!" or "Incorrect!" displays once the user chooses the answer.
* When the clock runs out or the user has answered all of the questions, the score and an input box appear to enter initials.
* When the submit button is clicked, the user can view all of their high scores (stored using local storage).
* The user has the option to take the quiz again. Each time their score will add to the high scores list. They can also choose to clear each score.

## Status
Mostly complete. I would like to include these things:
* More quiz questions.
* More quizzes focusing on different areas.
* Complex scoring system based on difficulty of questions.

## Inspiration
Thanks to my tutor who helped me so much with this homework.
